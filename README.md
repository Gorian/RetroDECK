**RetroDECK** brings an enviornment to catalog and play your retro games directly from SteamOS and it's tailored specifically for the **Steam Deck**.

It's powered by based on embedded emulation systems like 351ELEC, EmuELEC, CoreELEC, Lakka, and Batocera.

Powered by [EmulationStation Desktop Edition](https://es-de.org), RetroArch and standalone emulators allows you to import your favorite retro (but even not-so-retro) games in a tidy enviornment without flooding your Steam library.

**What does it means "tailored for the Steam Deck"?**\
Means that all the configurations are ready and tweaked to get the best graphics and perfomances on the Deck itself without having the hassle to choose, install and congifure tons of emulators: just put your games in the roms folder, provide your own bioses and you can start your games.

**Do I have to partition my disk to install it?**\
No, no partitioning or format is required: RetroDECK, diffrentely from 351ELEC, Batocera & co. comes as a flatpak: just install it as any other application and launch it from your desktop or Steam library.

**Is it available on Windows?**\
No, I don't support Windows, but the project is fully opensource so you can port it if you wish.

**Can I help?**\
Of course, any help is appreciated.
