# Not yet officially implemented in RetroDECK
Some of these features can be configured by the users manually but work is being done to implement across the board over time. 

**Missing features:**

* Cloud saves
* Netplay
* External controller support *
* External display resolution support
* Not all Emulators supported by ES-DE are included as of this moment (more will be added all the time).
* A configurator that is controller usable 
* Better art

( * External controller support "semi works" in some emulators if you have docked the Steam Deck and pair a Bluetooth controller inside the Steam Gamemode GUI. Not all hotkey combinations will work how ever!)
