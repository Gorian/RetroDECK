There is the possibility to provide custom emutlators provided by the user.

At the moment the only one available is Yuzu.
Create a folder named "yuzu" lowercase and place there your AppImage, so the path should be:
retrodeck/customs/yuzu/yuzu*.AppImage

WARNINGS on custom emulators:
- Custom emulators are self managed: means that RetroDECK Team is not supporting nor troubleshooting them.
- Custom emulators could potentially break other included emulators configs: use them at your own risk.
- Remember to make the binary executable, otherwise they won't be launched.
- Hotkeys might not be working if not configured by the users.
